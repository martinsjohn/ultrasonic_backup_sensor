# ultrasonic_backup_sensor
A custom arduino-based project for retrofitting a car with ultrasonic back-up sensors 

This code is written for
     * HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
     * SSD1306 OLED Display (128x64)

Arduino Libraries needed: 
     * U8glib
     * Ultrasonic

I used Photopea to create the OLED images and extracted their C-code bitmaps using https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/
* The .psd file contains all the layers for Photopea
